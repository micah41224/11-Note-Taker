## Project Description

This week's assignment required that I build the backend and routing for an application that enables the user to record notes in a db.json file. The user is able to save new notes, view previously recorded ones and delete notes from that list. This application is accessible on Heroku!

## Technologies Used:

HTML, CSS, Javascript, Express.js, cLog.js, uuid4 package and bootstrap
